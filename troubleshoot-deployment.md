# Troubleshooting GitHub Pages 404 Error

## Immediate Steps to Fix

### 1. Check GitHub Actions Status
Go to: https://github.com/vishnuts90/sun-direction-climate-app/actions

Look for:
- ✅ "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
- ✅ Green checkmark (success) or red X (failed)
- ✅ Recent runs (should be from today)

### 2. Check GitHub Pages Settings
Go to: https://github.com/vishnuts90/sun-direction-climate-app/settings/pages

**What should be configured:**
- Source: "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
- If it shows "Deploy from a branch", change it to "GitHub Actions"

### 3. Verify Repository is Public
GitHub Pages requires public repositories for free accounts:
- Go to: https://github.com/vishnuts90/sun-direction-climate-app/settings
- Scroll down to "Danger Zone"
- Check if repository is "Public" or "Private"

### 4. Manual Trigger Deployment
If no workflow has run:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select "main" branch
5. Click "Run workflow"
