# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Upload Files to GitHub
Upload these updated files to your repository:

- `package.json` - Fixed scripts (no more bunx)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Main deployment workflow
- `.github/workflows/deploy-fallback.yml` - Fallback workflow

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go to: https://github.com/vishnuts90/sun-direction-climate-app/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click **Save**

### 3. Check Deployment Status
1. Go to: https://github.com/vishnuts90/sun-direction-climate-app/actions
2. Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Wait for it to complete (should take 2-3 minutes)

### 4. Access Your Deployed App
Once deployment is complete, your app will be available at:
**https://vishnuts90.github.io/sun-direction-climate-app**

## What's Been Fixed

✅ **Dependency conflicts** - Updated lucide-react-native to support React 19
✅ **Script issues** - Replaced bunx with npx for compatibility
✅ **Deployment workflow** - Added proper GitHub Pages deployment
✅ **Fallback deployment** - Backup method if main deployment fails

## Testing Your Deployed App

1. **Web Browser**: Visit the GitHub Pages URL
2. **Mobile Browser**: Open the URL on your phone
3. **Features to Test**:
   - Location services
   - Sun position calculation
   - Weather data
   - Responsive design

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Verify all files are uploaded correctly
4. Check that the repository is public (required for free GitHub Pages)
